## NkdSu Hummingbird Voting Recommendation

### What?

Toridesu~ is a small site that gives you voting recommendations for Neko Desu (https://nkd.su). Toridesu~ uses your hummingbird library to check what you are watching or have seen before and then searches the song database for matches.

At the moment, the site will only show you matches as theres no way to vote yet and it might be prone to falling over, but hey Birds either fly or die.

Feel free to give me thoughts and improvements for it!

### Setting Up

1. Run `npm install` from the directory
2. Run `gulp dev` (may require installing Gulp globally)
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the application

Now that `gulp dev` is running, the server is up as well. Any changes will be automatically processed by Gulp and the server will be updated.
